# Semantic Uncertainty: linguistic invariances for uncertainty estimation in natural language generation.

## Note:
1. off-the-shelf: This means using some models which is trained before rather than train a new model.
2. Unsupervised approach: unsupervised approach don't have labels in training. So the purpose of it is to find the hidden structure of data.
3. Sueprvised approach: supervised approach have labels and use loss function in training. It can adjust it's parameters. Image classification and Language predicting are belong to it.
4. "We critically analyse the probabilisitic interpretation of language models in order to ground both our method and future exploration of the field"
