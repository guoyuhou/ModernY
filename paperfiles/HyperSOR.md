# HyperSOR:Context-Aware Graph Hypernetwork for Salient Object Rankinng(2024.9.2)

## Salient object detection
Salient object detection is a research derection of computer vision. This technique is aimed to imitate human vision.

### Technique prinsiples
1. Salient object detection always based on CNN or other model in deep learning.
2. Salient object detection always use Encoder-Decoder architecture  

## combination
1. HyperSOR is composed of the initial graph(IG) module, the scene perception(SPG) module and the ranking prediction graph(RPG) module. 

## Encoder-Decoder Architecture

## Conclusion
1. Learn about end-to-end network
2. We need to create some dataset for some tasks. This is maybe a innovation in the paper.
