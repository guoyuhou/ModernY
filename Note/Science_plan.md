# Science Plan

## 2024.9.4 CYX Talking.
1. Design and create a new program. 
2. If you want to be an scientist, you could gain rich experience in experimental design and conducting experiments. 
3. If you want to do some innovation based on these science programs and promote commercialization.Because the technoque in bussiness is not equal to academic research.Our teacher also have this demand.

1. Create a relax atmosphere
2. Talk about the culture of this program, find out the problems.
    1. Don't have enough knowledge of experiment and manangement.
    2. Haven't design a structure before doing it.
    3. Information is opaque and communication is not timely.
3. Help find jobs: 
    1. Competition (小挑战杯) and others, these could help find work if you choose to be an scientist and in laboratory.
### The structure of designing a program.
1. Find a direction based on market or hotspots or others.
2. Reading the relative papers or videos or anything.
3. Design the structure of the experiment, draw the graph of program.
4. 

### Consider the most important part.
When we design experiment, we need to remind us that we need to consider the important part. and then others. We shouldn't stop at a small point.

### Paper reading:
1. Advanced material, Advanced functional material
2. 知云翻译
3. Storm Genie: This is a generating-ai to generate a simple PDF which include the majority of the direction that you want.

### Find the deepest knowledge of programs.
1. What is your reasearch direction ? 
2. What pain point can your research address ? 
3. What methods did you use to solve these problems ?  
4. What the fundmental principle of your reseach ? (The principle of delving into the molecular level)
